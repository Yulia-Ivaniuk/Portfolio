# Bank data analysis - Research on the reliability of borrowers

**Description:**  Analysis of the bank data on the solvency of clients to identify whether the client's marital status, number of children, income level and purpose of the loan affect the return of  the loan on time, and to compile a reliable customer portrait. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model.

**Skills/Tools:**  Data preprocessing (duplicates, missing data, anomalies, data categorization), Pandas

**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the most reliable clients for the bank are those who are officially married, have no children, have a high income (more than 200k RUB) and take a loan for real estate operations. On the other hand, unmarried customers with one or more children, with an income of less than 200k and taking a loan with the purpose of obtaining education or car operations, do not return the loan on time the most often.
