**Description:**  Analysis of the Moscow’s food service market data and a detailed study of the coffee shop market in order to find the best location and develop the recommendations for opening a new coffee shop.

**Skills/Tools:** data preprocessing, data visualization (boxplot, piechart, bar plot, stacked bar chart, Maps), Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium (Map, Marker, Choropleth, MarkerCluster)

**Conclusion:**  Various Moscow’s food service market characteristics were identified within this research, such as the most and the least popular districts and streets in terms of number of food establishments, ratio of chain establishments by category, biggest food chains, average ratings and prices by food service category and district, ratio of 24/7 establishments by category and district, etc. These characteristics and the results of the study of the coffee shop market were taken into account while developing recommendations for a new coffee shop opening: 

-	For the location it's recommended focusing on the Central District which is the leader in terms of the number of establishments in general and coffee houses in particular, however it’s dictated by high demand and traffic.
-	It's recommended looking at average-popular streets with 20-30 establishments to make sure there is a good traffic, but no high competition. It's recommended paying attention to Malaya Bronnaya Street, Komsomolsky Avenue and Myasnitskaya Street, which have the smallest number of coffee houses per 1 km in the Central District - 1.1, 1.7 and 2.5, respectively.
-	Komsomolsky Prospekt also has the lowest average rating for coffee shops, 4.17, which reduces competition on this street, provided that the new coffee shop can achieve a high rating.
-	It is worth focusing on the median cost of a cup of coffee on the selected street (provided in the research) in order to be competitive.
-	It is not recommended to open a 24/7 coffee shop, as based on the data, 24/7 establishments represents only 4% of the market, which is most likely dictated by low demand.
