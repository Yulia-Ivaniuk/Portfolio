**Description:**  Analysis of the bank's customer’s data in order to compile a portrait of customers who tend to leave the bank, and develop recommendations for customer retention. Building a dashboard showing the number of customers depending on the number of products used, as well as the percentage of remaining in the bank and the percentage of churn customers with a filter by city

The following steps were taken:
-	Correlation analysis between different customers characteristics and churn rate
-	Based on the results of customer’s data analysis, we compiled a portraits of the churn customer and found a few customer segments with a highest churn rate
-	Tested 2 hypotheses to see if there is a statistically significant difference in revenue level and number of products between the remaining and churn customers

**Skills/Tools:** data preprocessing, data categorization, data visualization, testing of statistical hypotheses (u-test), Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, Tableau

**Conclusion:** Based on the results of research, below is the portrait of the churn customer:

The following recommendations for customer retention were developed:

-	to retain male customers by offering them lower interest rates for car loans or car insurance
-	to retain customers in the 50-60 age category by offering profitable pension plans
-	to retain customers aged 25-35 by lower mortgage interest rates or a bank subscription offer with additional bonuses for online shopping, online films and music services
-	to offer better terms on loan products or property insurance policies for the customers with a high property score 
-	for active customers and for customers with multiple products, the bank needs to make sure that customers do not experience difficulties in interacting with the bank and to pay attention to the level of services and customer satisfaction
