**Conclusion:** The analysis of active donor profiles has led to targeted recommendations for reactivating donor engagement. Key strategies include:
- Youthful Engagement Initiatives:
  * Implementing more proactive communication with donors aged 20-30 through email campaigns.
  * Involving partner companies and bonus programs aligned with the interests of this age group.
  * Organizing events tailored to attract and involve young donors.
- Regional Focus for Increased Activity: Strengthening communication efforts in regions with low donor activity, with special emphasis on Moscow and St. Petersburg, the leading donor hubs.
- User Retention Strategy: Developing a comprehensive strategy for retaining users, recognizing that donors typically become inactive 1.5 to 2 years post-registration.
- Revamping Bonus Programs: Addressing the underutilization of bonuses by inactive donors, potentially through the introduction of new partners with enticing offerings.
- Multichannel Communication Approach: Recognizing that inactive donors may not always provide email and phone details, advocating for diversified communication channels, including leveraging the popularity of VK, a widely-used social network among inactive donors.
  
These recommendations aim to revitalize donor engagement, attract new participants, and ensure sustained involvement from both existing and potentially inactive donors, aligning with the overarching goal of fostering a vibrant and enduring donor community for DonorSearch.org.
