**Description:**  Research analysis of the historical data on games sales, users and experts ratings, games genres and platforms to compile regional user portraits and to identify criteria and patterns that determine the success of the game. The results of the research will be used while planning marketing campaigns.

**Skills/Tools:**  data preprocessing (duplicates, missing data, anomalies, data categorization), data visualization (boxplot, scatterplot, piechart, bar plot, line plot), testing of statistical hypotheses (t-test), Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy

**Conclusion:**  As a result of the research, it appears that the video games market began to develop actively since 1995, reaching its maximum in volume of sales in 2008 and 2009, and started to decline since 2010. The growth of the gaming industry can be explained by the development of technology in the industry of gaming platforms and consoles, the arrival of social networks and mobile game sales services, while the market decline was most likely caused by the financial crisis of 2008.

While analyzing gaming platforms, it was identified that the average life cycle of a platform is 10 years.  During 2014-2016 PS4 and XOne were absolute leaders on the market. While the average number of sold games are the same for both platforms, the total sales of games on PS4 during 2014-2016 are 2 times higher than sales on XOne. This means that the PS4 has some very successful or exclusive games that have had a big impact on overall sales. 3DS console is also in the top 3 popular platforms on the market.

An analysis of the data on user’s and critic’s ratings showed that there is no clear relationship between these ratings and sales. At the same time, critic’s rating is more important than user’s rating.

An analysis of the video games genres showed that the most popular ones were Shooter, Sports and Platforms, and the most unpopular ones were Strategy, Puzzle and Adventure. This shows that an average user prefers simple and entertaining games. At the same time, Action, Shooter and Sports turned out to be the most profitable genres, which indicates that there are several very successful games in the Action genre that greatly affected the overall sales of games. Genres with the lowest sales are Simulation, Strategy and Puzzle.

The study of the user portrait in different regions showed that the markets and users of North America(NA) and Europe(EU) are very similar, while the Japan(JP) region has many differences. NA and EU users prefer PlayStation and XBox consoles and most often play fast, easy, entertaining Action, Shooter and Sports games. JP users prefer the 3DS mobile console and PlayStation consoles, and more often prefer to play more complex and long games with a story, like in the Role-Playing genre, but they also like Action games. There are also unique games in the region that have not gained popularity in other regions. The ESRB rating is relevant for the NA and EU regions, but does not affect the JP market.

The 2 following hypotheses were also tested during the research:

-	The average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same. The hypothesis could not be rejected.
-	The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The hypothesis was confirmed.
