**Description:** The project aims to address a significant challenge in the Russian healthcare system, where essential medical statistics are currently stored in complex formats, causing inefficiencies for healthcare professionals. Specifically focusing on cancer care data, the project's objective is to create a user-friendly DataLens dashboard. This tool will facilitate data-driven decision-making by simplifying the analysis of cancer treatment statistics. It will offer insights into the treatment of patients with tumors in various locations, the utilization of diverse treatment methods, and the treatment of patients across different age groups. The primary data source for this project is the 2021 annual report from the chief oncologist of the Russian Federation, specifically tables No. 54, 57-85. The DataLens dashboard will enable medical professionals to access and interpret this crucial information with ease, ultimately improving the quality of cancer care in Russia.

**Skills/Tools:** preprocessing of a large number of similar files, Pandas, Yandex DataLens

**Conclusions:** the analysis of medical statistics data in Russia reveals some significant findings, such as regions with the highest and the lowest completion of radical cancer treatment, the leading tumor locations for the completion of radical cancer treatment, the most widely used treatment methods within regions and tumor locations, etc.
